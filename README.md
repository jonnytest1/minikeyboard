!!!! source is just downlaoded from some google drive zip or something - but it worked so i at least put it here for documentation and SEO (cause it was annoying to find as well , you can probably take the amount of stars as a credibility score ðŸ˜…)

if you have a different keyboard for which this works please send me a pr to include it in the readme for SEO
