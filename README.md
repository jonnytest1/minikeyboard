!!!! source is just downlaoded from some google drive zip or something - but it worked so i at least put it here for documentation and SEO (cause it was annoying to find as well , you can probably take the amount of stars as a credibility score ðŸ˜…)

if you have a different keyboard for which this works please send me a pr to include it in the readme for SEO

confirmed working:
1189:8890 / ch57x / maybe ch552 keyboards from aliexpress like https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804794211891.html and similar
ignore layout on software, position knobs on the right side and count keys off from left to right for each row starting at the top (eg if you have 6 keys total in 2 rows, use keys 1 thru 6 in the software not just the first 3 on the first 2 rows)
any keyboard with vendor id 1189/product id 8890 and max of 16 keys and 3 knobs should work even if layers and rgb aren't supported
